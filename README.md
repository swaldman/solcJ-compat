# solcJ-compat

This is a project that means to generate "fat jar" files containing
self-contained compiler binaries for [solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) under Mac, Windows, and Linux,
in the format pioneered by, and compatible with those generated by
[ether-camp/solcJ](https://github.com/ether-camp/solcJ).

*Self-contained is relative. In particular, Windows builds currently require a Visual Studio runtime dll
that cannot be bundled with `solc` since it is not open source. For the current version of `solc` (0.4.18), the
Visual Studio 2015 runtime works. You can download that from Microsoft here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145*

All scripting is done in [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org), so builds
should be portable and reproducible. To build a jar for a new version
of solc, the following steps are required:

1. Reset the version in `build.sbt` to a version number beginning
   with the base version of `solc` you wish to bundle. Any non-numeric
   suffix is acceptible. For example, if you wish to bundle
   `solc` version `0.4.18+commit.9cf6e910.Darwin.appleclang`, acceptible
   versions in `build.sbt` would be `0.4.18`, `0.4.18rev1`, `0.4.18-SNAPSHOT`,
   etc. at your discretion. Only the dot-separated base semantic version,
   `0.4.18` in this case, is used by the project
2. In `src/main/versions` create a directory named precisely the dot-separated
   base semantic version, e.g. "0.4.18". Within this directory, create
   the following three subdirectory paths:
   * `native/mac/solc`
   * `native/win/solc`
   * `native/linux/solc`
3. Within each of the three `solc` directories defined above, place appropriate
   binaries. The binaries ideally will be self-contained statically linked
   compilatins of the solidity compiler, but if shared libraries or other resources
   are required, these may be bundled alongside the binaries in the same directory
   or subdirectories, if the binary will link them by relative path.
   *The compiler binaries themselves must be called `solc` or `solc.exe`.*
4. Once the binaries are available, to build the jar file, it's just
   ```
   $ sbt package
   ```
   You will find the jar file in th target directory.

The project may contain binaries for multiple versions of `solc`.
Which version is bundled into the jar files produced depends on the
version setting in `build.sbt`.

This project includes binaries from [solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity)
and is indebted to [solcJ](https://github.com/ether-camp/solcJ).

It is licensed under GPLv3, after the solidity compiler itself.

**Note:** *When building solc from a release build, `touch prerelease.txt` at
the top-level of the solidity distribution so that the build is not flagged as
a development build (and does not emit annoying warnings about being a
prerelease version. See
